# PROJECT NAME

# Project_Management_System3

# GENERAL INFORMATION

# This menu-driven project is the last of the 3 part series with added features
# to read existing projects from an existing txt file while the information is
# used to create a list of project objects. Furthermore, the menu allows the user to 
# select and update or finalize any project on the list which is written to a second 
# txt file "CompletedProject". Additionally, the user can see a list of projects that still
# need to be completed as well as projects that are past the due date and projects that are updated.
# The program uses various methods, try-catch blocks, string handling, and getter and setters.

# There will be a 4th Project Management System Project that will focus on most of this code in the 5 Java files
# and adding databases using JDBC programming.

# TECHNOLOGY

# IDE Eclipse Version: 2020-9(4.17.0)

# PROJECT STATUS

# This is the final Project Management System before a database is added to the prigram.
